## Project Description

### Brief
For this project your team will have completely free reign to design and build a full-stack application to provide a service or solve a problem that you want to work on. You have 1.5 weeks to work on this and you will need to consider all of the steps involved in the previous projects. On the final day you will present your work to your colleagues, instructors and clients.

### Tech Stack

This is a full-stack project, meaning it must include both front and back ends. This is done by building a React app connecting to a Spring back-end (to consolidate the work we have done so far on the course).



## Setup Instructions

    1. Clone the Repo into your terminal: git@github.com:DarshilDholakia/European_Super_League.git
    2. Open server-side repo ("ESL_backend") in IntelliJ and run the SpringBoot application ("eslApplication.java").
    3. Open client-side repo ("esl_frontend") in Visual Studio Code (VSC) and run the following code in the VSC in-built terminal:
        - npm install
        - npm start
    4. Interact with site - create/edit your team!
